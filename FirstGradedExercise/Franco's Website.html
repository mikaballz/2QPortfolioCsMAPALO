        <h2> ROBLOX </h2>

        <h2> Explanation: </h2>
        <p> Roblox can be better described as less of a game itself, and more so a catalogue of games, built inside Roblox's game engine. This fact is what makes Roblox my favorite game- every genre of game you can think of is on Roblox, a vast majority of which are for free. Adventures, Story Games, Visual Novels, First-Person Shooters, Chase Games, Strategy, Bullet Hell, is all likely on Roblox for the masses to enjoy. </p> <br>
            <p> My favorite game within roblox itself has varied over the years, shifting from a building & engineering game (Plane Crazy) to a strategy game (Rise of Nations) to, currently, a hyperrealistic first-person shooter (Hellmet). However, the single common thing about these is that they are all in Roblox. These games beat out others like Wuthering Waves, Minecraft, Reverse:1999, and War Thunder, which are all games I personally love, but not necessarily games I can love on all occasions. </p> <br>
            <p> Take the case of War Thunder, as example. 
                This game is infamous for its sweaty, tryhard players and severe skill requirement. Not the best option to come home to after a long day of work, unlike coming home to a relaxing game about mechanical engineering- Plane Crazy. A similar option could be Minecraft, offering peaceful playthroughs, remaining a constant backup when times are hard and nothing else seems to scratch that itch to create. It's issue is that it's best enjoyed multiplayer (which is not often available), its monotonous grind, and the fact it costs some Php500 just to get access to. Plane Crazy is free, and if you want to play a different game, Roblox has you. You don't need to buy and install a new game every time you get bored, you can simply scroll along the recommended tab, giving you results the algorithm thinks you'll enjoy.
            </p> <br>
            <p> Through thick and thin, busy times and times I feel purposeless, Roblox has been there for me. Always offering a release when nothing else will.</p> <br>
