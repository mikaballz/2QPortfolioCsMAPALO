        <h2> ROBLOX </h2>

        <h2> Explanation: </h2>
        <p> Roblox is a platform with a multitude of community made games for players, and it includes a wide variety of experiences, which are fun to play (atleast for some). You can also enjoy games with friends you can meet online or in real life. This game is fun for me because it is one way to relieve stress by playing with friends and since Roblox is mostly community handled, your abilities and creativity are bound to your imagination. Overall 8/10. </p>
