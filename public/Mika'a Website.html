<div class="text-block">
        <h2> What is Punishing Gray Raven?</h2> <br>
        <p> Punishing Gray Raven is an Role-playing, Adventure, and Visual Novel Game.</p> 
        <p> It is known as a gacha game, wherein you would have to spend in-game currency to achieve wanted characters. 
            It is developed by Kuro Game and was released on May 28, 2020.
        The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world where humanity is on the brink of extinction due to a 
        robotic virus called the Punishing. The characters can be pulled through this system that is called the gacha system. 
         The game has a unique combat system that combines fast-paced action with strategic elements. 
         Players can switch between different characters on the fly, each with their own abilities and playstyles. </p>

            <h2> Why is it my favorite game?</h2> <br>
            <p> I really enjoy playing this game because of its storyline and characters. I also like playing this game because of its storyline and characters. 
                It is fun to play and has a lot of depth to it. The game also has a lot of replay value, as there are many different characters to collect and upgrade. Other than that, 
                it doesn't really require a lot of time or effort to play. I can just play it whenever I want and not have to worry about it. Overall, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fun and engaging mobile game to play. </p>

                <h2> More information on PGR!</h2>
                    <h3> 1. What are the different compositions and teams?</h3>
                        <p> There are multiple compositions in PGR. A team is made up of 3 members. They are all split by elements and their specialty. Some characters 
                            may have the same element but have different roles within a team composition. The different elements are:
                            Fire, Ice, Lightning, Physical, Wind, and Quantum. The different roles are:
                            Main DPS, Sub DPS, Enabler, Support, and QTE Support. </p> <br>
                    <h3> 2. Team Compositions </h3>
                        <p> Team compositions don't really have to be that serious. You can literally put your favorite characters 
                            into one team, and nobody would stop you, or care about it. But if you want a more impactful team 
                            (in terms of damage output and survivability), you can follow multiple team compositions posted online, or on reddit.
                            You can also create your own team compositons based on the characters that you have, but more likely than not, it is probably already 
                            posted somewhere online. I highly recommend checking out online sources for team compositions, especially if you are a beginner because 
                            the elements and abilities of each characters are insanely complex and hard to understand at first. </p> <br>
                   
                    <h3> 3. Rank/Leveling Up Characters </h3>
                        <p> PGR has character ranks associated with the version of that specific character.
                            You can upgrade each character to be a higher rank. The ranks are based on letters, with SSS+ being the highest.
                            However, it is important to note that the highest rank you can gain from the gacha system (of a character), 
                            is S rank. After that, you'd have to buy duplicates or pull more from the gacha system in order to upgrade the rank of the character.
                            You can upgrade A rank characters to be SSS+, but they obviously won't be as strong as characters who's rank basis is S. </p> <br>

                    <h3> 4. Memory </h3>
                        <p> Other than weapons, characters also have something called Memory's. Memory's are like accessories that give boosts and bonuses
                            to characters. Each character has their own unique set of Memory's that are made specifically for them. 
                            However, you can absolutely mismatch and use different memory's on different characters. A lot of reddit users and online posts
                            are smart enough to make guides on what memory's are best for each character. This way, you can absolutely maximaxe the damage 
                            output of your characters. Some players have found that certain memory's work better on different characters, even if they aren't 
                            specifically made for them. It's all about testing and experimenting on the right combination that works for you! </p> <br>
                            
                    <h3> 5. Weapons </h3>
                        <p> Each character has their own unique weapon that supports their character wholeheartedly.
                            You can use different weapons on different characters, but it is highly recommended to use the weapon
                            that is specifically made for that character. You can also upgrade these weapons to make them stronger.  </p> <br>
