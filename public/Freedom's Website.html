        <h2> BLEACH BRAVE SOULS </h2>

        <h2> Explanation: </h2>
        <p> Bleach Brave Souls is my favorite game since it came from my favorite anime, Bleach. It lures me in further when I see the beautiful cards that contain my favorite characters or characters I find pretty or useful to help me in my gameplay. 

Other than visuals, I also play it since it contains novels that the author made. Like Can’t Fear Your Own World (CFYOW), it was included there even if it wasn’t even animated yet. It’s generous in giving more information after the events of the end of Bleach for the fans that don't have the novels.</p>
